# Bird-Classification-Using-ResNet
Bird identification is a difficult task due to limited visual abilities for humans. However, using computers and neural networks, bird recognition can be performed reliably and easily. The idea of this assignment is to implement bird classification problem using pre-trained ResNet models and compare the performance of different models such as ResNet34, ResNet50 and ResNet152 with respect to different number of epochs.
